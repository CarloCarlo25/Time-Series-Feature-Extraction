# Heart Disease Prediction Using Taken's Embedding and Persistent Homology on Simplicial Complexes
## Objective
This code offers a new way at analyzing a time series data. Here, I used Taken's embedding to embed an electrocardiogram (ECG) data onto an n-dimensional manifold. After that, I used persistent
Homology on simplicial complexes to train the classifiers to spot an anomaly in the ECG signal.
